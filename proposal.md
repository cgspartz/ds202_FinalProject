The Data set that I plan on using is the team injury statistics from 2000 until 2020. The NFL is the professional sports league for the sport of American Football, it has been active since the 1920s, and is currently the most popular sport on television every weekend	in the fall/winter time.

Questions for exploratory Analysis:
What teams dealt with the most injuries from 2000 until 2020. 
What team dealt with the longest average injuries to players.
What coach dealt with the most injuries while he was the head coach of a team.
Did the length of injuries increase or decrease as time went on.
What Position tends to get the most injured.
What position gets injured the least.
What position has the longest injuries.
What position has the shortest average injuries.
