The Data set that I plan on using is the team injury statistics from all NFL teams from 2010 until 2020. The NFL is the professional sports league for the sport of American Football, it has been active since the 1920s, and is currently the most popular sport on television every weekend	in the fall/winter time.

The data set that I plan on using from pro football reference is the injury report for each team in every season, and the rosters for each year. I plan on getting this data by scraping the website. In order to analyze the data from the website I will need to join together multiple data frames in order to look at data between each of them. Once the data has been cleaned and put together then I will begin working on the questions for exploratory analysis listed below:

Questions for exploratory Analysis:
What teams dealt with the most injuries from 2000 until 2020. 
What team dealt with the longest average injuries to players.
Did the length of injuries increase or decrease as time went on.
How did the amount of injuries affect the winning percentage of a team.
What position being injured most affected the winning percentage of a team.
What Position tends to get the most injured.
What position gets injured the least.
What position has the longest injuries.
What position has the shortest average injuries.
